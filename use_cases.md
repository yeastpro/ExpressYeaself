[Why is this project useful]

[Biological background]

Transcription factors are proteins that regulate the transcription of genes (which is their copying into RNA on the 
way to making a protein). These factors ensure that the right genes are expressed in the right cells at the right 
time, by turing specific genes "on" or "off" by binding to nearby DNA. A transcription factor binds to DNA at a 
certain target sequence. Once bound, the factor can make it easier or more difficult for RNA polymerase to bind to 
the promoter of the gene. 

Protein expression refers to the way in which proteins are synthesized, modified and regulated. In the case of this 
project...


Determining the heterologous protein expression in eukaryotes, such as yeast, has been an ongoing challenge in research. 
However, with a greater understanding of transcription factors, it should be possible to manipulate and fine tune levels 
of expression. Ultimately, this aids in improving the efficiency and reducing the cost and environmental burden of 
producing necessary biopharmaceuticals, such as insulin. 

In the past few years, there has been a collective effort to systematically explore these transcription factors and 
their impacts using natural and synthetic biology. This has generated millions of data points which can now be 
integrated together to identify transcriptional motifs, sequences and positions, using machine learning techniques. 
This allows the determination of the transcription factors that have the greatest impact on protein expression, which 
can then be used to develop an optimized predictive model. 


Objectives

The objective of ExpressYeaself is to develop a greater understanding of the configurations
of transcription factors and the resultant effects on the protein expression of yeast,
through a comprehensive predictive model.
